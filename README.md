# Crosschain-framework

So typcially the issues faced in the conventional blockchains are lack of connectivity between them and instead of bridges and performing a cross chain and sending out the wrapped assets, there is a need to send the actaul assets onto different blockchains and todays centralised exchanges aren't that different from the traditional banks and this actaully defeats the purpose of using the decentralised exchages due to the fact that nobody is actaully using bridges to perform the transaction as fee needed to be covered on two blockchains now imagine this scenario where 100's of blockchains need to communicate and this would cause increased fee rendering blockchains typcially useless. so in this we replace the traditional bridge architure with something compeltly new structure with layer 2 and layer 3. 


note if we have a low cost layer2 solution then do we need to use any other alternatives to bitcoin?
